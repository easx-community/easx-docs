Connecting directly to the EAS service","text":"<p>This approach is the easiest and quickest to get up and running, but does not provide maximum end-to-end security. It requires you to make calls directly to EAS API. You can find specifications, request structure, samples of code in most programming languages on the Developer Portal.</p> <p>For example, to get a list of incoming documents using this method, you will have to send a <code>GET</code> request to the specific URL and handle resulting response in json format. This can be done in any programming language, or even with a batch script using curl. Thus, it is possible to create a batch/shell script and configure it to run every few hours using Windows Task Scheduler or a cron job.</p> <p>This method requires you to attach a few security related headers and specify a client certificate file. But, encryption, decryption and signing of the documents is handled on the server side. So, EAS API will expect you to send and receive documents in clear text. All messages will still be encrypted and validated (https, subscription keys, client certificates), but there will be no end to end encryption of the document payload.</p>"},{"location":"How-To-Connect/#2-connecting-via-the-eas-client","title":"2.

For example, to get all incoming documents into a folder, you will have to run the client like <code>EASClient.exe --receive \"incoming folder\"</code>. The client will also handle all additional actions, like sending receipts, automatically.</p> <p>To send a document, you'll have to copy it into the specified folder, and run the send command <code>EASClient.exe --send \"outgoing folder\"</code>.</p> <p>Just like in direct approach, it is possible to create a simple batch/shell script and configure it to run every few hours using Windows Task Scheduler or a cron job. With just a few simple commands, you will get the highest level of security.</p> <p>Note: Command line scripts are only available when the EAS Client is deployed as an executable file, not docker instance.</p> <ol> <li>Client API request.</li> </ol> <p>In case you'd like to integrate EAS API into your application, but you don't want to implement encryption, signing and validations yourself, consider using this approach. After running EAS Client in host mode, it will launch a local instance of EAS API that does not require any security.</p> <p>This way, you will send a simple unencrypted http requests to the local client URL. The client will then validate your request, generate signature, encrypt the payload, attach required subscription headers, attach the client certificate, specify default UID and finally send the request to remote EAS API. Upon receiving the response, the client will validate signature, decrypt the payload and return the decrypted response.</p> <p>Just like in direct approach, it is possible to create a simple batch/shell script and configure it to run every few hours using Windows Task Scheduler or a cron job. And in case you'd like to integrate it in your application, there is an OpenAPI Specification to facilitate the process.</p> <ol> <li>Client GUI</li> </ol> <p>In case you'd like to perform document exchange manually, view the logs, change EAS Client settings or experiment with local API, consider using this approach. After running EAS Client in host mode, it will launch a local instance of EAS client GUI. It allows you to access all the features of EAS Client from your browser. After navigating to a specified local URL, you will be able to send, view and manage documents, receipts, access client directory, logs, etc. GUI also includes Swagger and Open API Specification, so it can be used to try out the local API.</p> <p>This approach might work for you in case you would like to perform all the actions manually. For example, you can just create a shortcut to launch EAS Client in hosted mode. Then, you'll just launch the shortcut, open an Incoming Documents web page in your browser, and download a document without having to deal with encryptions or commands whatsoever.</p>"},{"location":"EAS-Client/Settings/","title":"Settings","text":"<p>This document explains where to configure EAS Client settings and contains detailed descriptions of all parameters that can be configured in EASX Client.</p>"},{"location":"EAS-Client/Settings/#how-to-configure","title":"How to configure","text":"<p>There are 3 ways of configuring the EAS Client.</p>"},{"location":"EAS-Client/Settings/#a-command-line-parameters","title":"A.
